2021-01-28 00:00:29	hexnewbie	You cannot replace sudo with a userspace flag, as the whole point of sudo is that it does something way more sophisticated than a flag. You cannot fine-grain stuff with a flag, you'd end up writing your own ad-hoc security-ridden sudo if sudo didn't exist.

2021-01-28 00:03:32	Aryan	fsg That is more likely -N. What about -f? When do you need to use -f instead of -N?

2021-01-28 00:05:45	Aryan	And another thing, when you created a tunnel with -N, how do you stop that process? Is there anything built-in to ssh to stop background connections or should you do ps -aux and kill that process?
2021-01-28 00:05:51	hexnewbie	terabit: You can always create e.g. a tool named 'suidx' in userspace, that, upon setuidx ping, reads security.setuidx of /bin/ping, and allows you to run it if your user is listed, so you wouldn't need a kernel flag.
2021-01-28 00:05:51	Masklin	akik: Yeah rollback means you're booted from an old snapshot.
2021-01-28 00:06:01	terabit	hexnewbie: hmm, so you're saying the setuid flag is enough, except something else in userspace needs to manage the transition to a whole new user like sudo does, why not the command interpreter (bash)

2021-01-28 00:08:51	terabit	hexnewbie: also, with setuid root, the file needs to be owned by root right? with sudo it doesn't
2021-01-28 00:08:55	hexnewbie	terabit: Having maintained setuid user-switching tools, though, I'd say you're better off with sudo. What was a 100-line switching tool turned out to have a security hole when dropping privileges, so it was needed to port 1000 lines from, I think, sudo to implement use_pty.
2021-01-28 00:08:59	Lope	how can I get all the lines in a file, except for the last line?

2021-01-28 00:09:55	hexnewbie	Elevating privileges is easy. Dropping them is a pain. You need to create a new PTY, and what not.
2021-01-28 00:10:46	terabit	hexnewbie: just tested what you said, I did +s on ping and ran it, it runs as my normal user not as root. although it may have process permissions to do things as root (e.g.: if it touches a file it would be as my user?)
