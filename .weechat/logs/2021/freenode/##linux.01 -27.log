2021-01-27 21:23:23	podeni	Hey everyone. Question: is there a way to run GNU parallel or another tool in a way that would allow me to pipe the contents of a file to 4 processes as distinct stdins? The way I use it, parallel keeps spawning a new process for each line while maintaining N processes running, what I want is to have N processes each consume a line from a main pipe until it's done.

2021-01-27 23:15:08	castbreeder	hello folks, looking for answer how linux manages program instructions with regard to dynamically linked shared libaries. Let's consider a C compiled a.out executable which uses printf from stdlib (libc.so). Once ./a.out is executed, the process gets a memory block allocated which has a code segment. Once printf is called - how does it work from here on? Does all of printf code get copied to the code segment of a.out process (as a
2021-01-27 23:15:09	castbreeder	local copy of the libray)? Or does the instruction pointer move to some other part of memory where shared library is loaded and that code segment is shared for all user-space programs?

Letting people run things as root is risky....so what I like is to make a script that uses no environment, cli args, files not owned by root, etc. and then it does a specific thing (eg. restart a daemon) and then they can't abuse it to do other things. So it has to be a script if the normal program will accept args.
